# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 19: February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: One more section in the 'Contoso University' tutorial by Microsoft completed.

**Thoughts:** I learned a bit more about async programming with ASP.NET today.  It's a way to free up threads when waiting for an I/O operation, which is especially helpful for high volume web applications.  Without it, each operation would need to complete before freeing up the resource for the next request.  Only a few more sections left in this tutorial.

### Day 18: February 09, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed another section in the 'Contoso University' tutorial by Microsoft.

**Thoughts:** Another section of the tutorial done.  I felt like I was kind of just going through the motions on this one.  Nothing really stood out to me.  It was very similar to the previous section, in that it was just updating the controller and related views for manipulating related data.  I feel like I'm ready to move on working on my project again, but I do want to finish out this tutorial.

### Day 17: February 08, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed one more section in the 'Contoso University' tutorial by Microsoft.

**Thoughts:** Learned about the differences between lazy, eager, and explicit loading, and when each situation might be beneficial to performance.  Seems like the only TRUE way to tell which one is better for the program is to test and see.  My initial thought is that sounds like a lot of work, BUT this could be something after the initial product is out the door (assuming performance isn't suffering).  I also learned how to retrieve related data and create ViewModels in order to achieve this.  This will help me with my meal planning app I'm sure.

### Day 16: February 06, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Another section finished in the 'Contoso University' tutorial by Microsoft.

**Thoughts:** There are 6 sections left in this tutorial.  I hope to do more than 1 per night, but this last section was pretty long.  I'm also trying to really understand the concepts before moving on, instead of just copy/pasting code just to say I did it.  I learned about complex data modeling using code first techniques.  I found a cool plugin I'm going to play around with later call Entity Framework 6 Power Tools - this is the program used to create the data relationship diagrams in the tutorial.  This could be a neat tool to use for planning future projects.

### Day 15: February 05, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Just finished another section in the 'Contoso University' tutorial by Microsoft.

**Thoughts:** Had to do a short session tonight, my wife's brother just had a baby!  We spent some time up at the hospital so my coding time was cut a little short.  Today I learned about code first migrations and it's benefit in a production environment.  Migrations allow you to make changes to the data model and update the database without dropping and readding.  This is especially helpful in production environments so you don't lose any data.

### Day 14: February 04, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished another section in the 'Contoso University' tutorial by Microsoft.

**Thoughts:** This tutorial series is going well.  I'm learning more about best practices and some behind-the-scene concepts than I thought I would.  I do wish that the tutorial would go more into detail about the code being written; it kind of glosses over the code and gives more broad information.  I did venture from the tutorial to learn a little more about interfaces.  I found a cool video that described interfaces as being loosely coupled.  The analogy given was a chef and a restaurant.  The restaraunt obviously needs a chef, but if the chef they have now decides to move on, they can just hire another chef.  This an example of a loosely coupled relationship.  A tightly coupled relationship would be a restaraunt that needs a chef named John.

### Day 13: February 03, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished 2 sections in the 'Contoso University' tutorial by Microsoft.

**Thoughts:** I've decided to step away from my recipe meal planner app for a moment.  I wasn't making any headway on an issue I was facing, so I've decided to revisit a tutorial that I started but did not finish.  The tutorial is going well, it's mainly showing me best practices for designing web applications, in regards to handling requests and data security.  I also learned some neat c# tricks like the null-coalescing operator.

### Day 12: February 02, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Helped others on discord and read up on (more) documentation.

**Thoughts:** I missed yesterday due to my wife's birthday.  I intended to still get my hour of coding in, but we went out after I got home from work, and we didn't get back until 12:30-1am.  I'll not count yesterday and add an additional day on the end of my challenge (per the rules). I've been trying to be more active on the Discord with helping and encouraging others taking part of the challenge.  I'm in a bit of a slump with my project, but hopefully I can make a breakthrough soon.

### Day 11: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not much.

**Thoughts:** This seems so simple, I'm getting a little frustrated that I can't figure it out.  I'm going to take a step back tomorrow and approach from a different angle.  Just read up on documentation and stack overflow posts, and tried a million different little solutions (none worked).

### Day 10: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work through linking the recipe model to the built in Identity library.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I've got the right idea in linking the recipe to the user - I'm think I'm close to getting it.  But I just can't quite get it to work.  I'm now getting an ```InvalidOperationException: Unable to resolve service for type``` error.  I think I need to add something to the Startup.cs class under the ConfigureServices method, but I can't figure out WHAT exactly.  I'll keep digging.

### Day 9: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finalized recipe model on paper, fiddled around with building the database using the code first method of the Entity Framework Core. 

**Thoughts:** I made some headway in understanding the code first method of datbase design in EFC.  I'm struggling right now with making the relations between tables actually work.  I've got everything planned out, and I'm sure I could write this all out in PL/SQL...but that's not the point of this project.  I seem to have the recipe table linked to the user table, but because the "user" table is from asp.net's Identity library, it's a bit more difficult to work with and understand.  I'm trying to figure out how to automatically get the current user and assign that to the recipe table upon creation.

### Day 8: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got stuck on revising the recipe model, completed part 1 of data model tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** I was feeling good with the progress I made in the past week (and I still am), but I realized that I need to get a little more complicated.  The tutorials I went through had implemented simple data models, but I need a "complex" data model for my recipe class.  I'll spend the next day or two in tutorials, and then its back to project work.

### Day 7: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got a working version of the recipe model, implemented the controller/view, and updated the EFCore database to recognize the new recipe model.   

**Thoughts:** I'm still not sure what's going on in the Identity library from Day 6, but I decided to move on for now and will continue researching at a later time.  I'm feeling good about the Recipe model I created, and my next steps are more front-end in nature.  I took care of the back-end work today with setting up the model and controller, but I need to modify the view to suit my needs.
EDIT: I found through some searching on Reddit that you can scaffold out the Identity library.  This reveals all of the views that I thought were missing, which is really helpful to see.  I still am not 100% on how the controller works.  The scaffold created a IdentityHostingStartup.cs, which is the closest thing to a controller I could find.  I still don't see where it's interpreting the URL and telling the program which view to serve.

### Day 6: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued thinking/planning data models in regards to recipies, meals, and ingredients.  Researched and read documentation regarding the Identity library for ASP.NET provided by the Entity Framework  

**Thoughts:** I'm leaving today feeling confused.  I'm trying to understand how the Identity library works in regards to authorization.  For example, if you sign in to the app and click your username at the top right, it takes you to a user page.  I CANNOT find where this is coded.  I see the \_LoginPartial.cshtml file in View/Shared.  That reveals to me that clicking on the username invokes a controller in area "Identity".  HOWEVER, I can't find this controller.  Check this out:
```
<li>
    <a asp-area="Identity" asp-page="/Account/Manage/Index" title="Manage">Hello @UserManager.GetUserName(User)!</a>
</li>
```     
So, I do see an Areas folder, and I can see this path: Areas/Identity/Pages/\_ViewStart.cshtml.  \_ViewStart just points to the shared \_Layout view.  But I do NOT see any controller, so how does it interpret "Account/Manage/Index"?  It's my understanding that there should be an AccountController somewhere, which has either/both a manage or/and index method.  I'm having a hard time finding the documentation on this...

### Day 5: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started on the meal planning app; added authorization and started planning out the classes/models.  

**Thoughts:** I'm a little overwhelmed on how to design the models for future proofing / reusability.  I want to make sure that what I code can be added on to and maintained and edited easily in the future.  I want to make sure that what I design makes sense and will work for what I'm trying to accomplish.  Does "food" need to be it's own class?  Or should it just be a property of the "recipe" class?  Does "meal" need it's own class, or can that just be the title of the recipe class?  I had fun playing around with authorization of the app and linking views to controllers.  I may need to step back and think about the design of the data before I go any further.

### Day 4: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished up Microsoft's MVC tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** Another reading/tutorial heavy day.  I can already see the benefit in going through the tutorials; I was even able to use what I've learned so far at work today.  An application that we support uses .NET and Oracle, and I was able to follow along and help a co-worker (shoutout to my boi Sposi) debug an issue today.  I was able to identify and understand lambda functions, async/await calls, and the interactions between models, views, and controllers.  I didn't spend quite an hour this evening in tutorials.  I finished a bit early, but since my next step is to actually start on my project, I'm going to wait until tomorrow so I can dedicate more uninterrupted time towards it.  Tomorrow I hope to progress in creating a login for my webapp using the SQL Server functionality built in the ASP.NET framework.

### Day 3: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Microsoft's MVC tutorial, finished one more section. 

**Thoughts:** I did a LOT of reading today.  I spent some time throughout the day finishing up the tutorial at TutorialsPoint, which gave a good overview of the interacting pieces of ASP.NET.  I went off a bit of a tangent from the Microsoft Tutorial and read up on Async/Await.  The documentation I've been reading hasn't covered that in detail even though it's present in the code.  I feel pretty comfortable with that terminology now, and I'm on track to finish the tutorial by the end of the week.  I've got high hopes and ambitions for my web app idea of a meal planner, so I'll be excited to get started on that here soon.

### Day 2: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Followed along Microsoft's MVC tutorial and finished up two sections.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day.  I determined what my "problem" was yesterday; I can read and understand c# just fine, I just don't quite understand the MVC model yet.  I made really good progress in understanding the relationship between Models, Views, and Controllers today.  I spent some time throughout the day passively reading documentation about MVC.  Then tonight, during my allotted coding time, I spent time in the interactive tutorial my Microsoft.  I'm still not sure about the async/await keywords and what EXACTLY they do.  I did think this was really cool, though:
```
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Welcome";
}

<h2>Welcome</h2>

<ul>
    @for (int i = 0; i < (int)ViewData["NumTimes"]; i++)
    {
        <li>@ViewData["Message"]</li>
    }
</ul>
```
Combining HTML and some actual programming is pretty saucy.

### Day 1: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Environment setup (VS 2017). Initial commit of web app. Progressed in MVC tutorial and initial commit.

**Thoughts:** Day number one.  I have high hopes for this challenge.  I am excited and a little nervous.  I overestimated what I actually knew about ASP.NET.  I can recall the terminology, but I'm a bit lost of where to begin.  I've decided to take a couple days to refresh my memory with tutorials.
