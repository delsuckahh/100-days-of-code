# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Environment setup (VS 2017). Initial commit of web app. Progressed in MVC tutorial and initial commit.

**Thoughts:** Day number one.  I have high hopes for this challenge.  I am excited and a little nervous.  I overestimated what I actually knew about ASP.NET.  I can recall the terminology, but I'm a bit lost of where to begin.  I've decided to take a couple days to refresh my memory with tutorials.

### Day 2: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Followed along Microsoft's MVC tutorial and finished up two sections.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day.  I determined what my "problem" was yesterday; I can read and understand c# just fine, I just don't quite understand the MVC model yet.  I made really good progress in understanding the relationship between Models, Views, and Controllers today.  I spent some time throughout the day passively reading documentation about MVC.  Then tonight, during my allotted coding time, I spent time in the interactive tutorial my Microsoft.  I'm still not sure about the async/await keywords and what EXACTLY they do.  I did think this was really cool, though:
```
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Welcome";
}

<h2>Welcome</h2>

<ul>
    @for (int i = 0; i < (int)ViewData["NumTimes"]; i++)
    {
        <li>@ViewData["Message"]</li>
    }
</ul>
```
Combining HTML and some actual programming is pretty saucy.
